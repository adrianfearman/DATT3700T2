DATT 3700 - Pseudocode Idea

// 4 Parts to the code, Pre-game, Game Sequence, Sequence Check and Post-Game
// for this pseudocode example, game is set to 3 Sounds



// PRE GAME - Processing
function random(){
	int Value1 = random number between 1 and 3
	int Value2 = random number between 1 and 3
	int Value3 = random number between 1 and 3


	Save sequence
	Send to MAX8 through SHIFTR
}



// GAME SEQUENCE - MAX8 
Receive sequence
Plays audio and visuals to a jit.window in order received (Value1, Value2 Value3)

game waits for player input

Players then sends input to Game via Arduino Input
Plays the visuals as they are pressed

Sends the player order to Processing through Shiftr



// SEQUENCE CHECK - PROCESSING
Receives order of input values from max8
checks order

if (order matches){
	send MAX8 a match CORRECT confirmation
	create new random values sequence (for the next round)
} else {
	send MAX8 a INCORRECT match signal
	resend old random sequence back to GAME SEQUENCE PART
}



// POST GAME - MAX8
receives input from SEQUENCE CHECK stage

if (received order correct) {
	play/display confirmation visuals
	update score ++
} else {
	replay old sound sequence
}
